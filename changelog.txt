Previously mentioned zombie pushback change was incomplete.  Headshot damage no longer deals extra pushback.  Pushback damage also has diminishing returns with increasingly high damage in one frame: weak sources of damage (glock, mp5) deal full pushback while close-range shotgun blasts are cut by 25%, fully-charged gauss shots by half.
-ALSO, crossbow bolts no longer deal pushback, but still take bullet reduction percentages.
-Future support for explosions to deal pushback, or for more monsters to support pushback possible.

HUD battery no longer drawn on top of the pain flash effect.  Pain flash is now drawn after all typical UI draw calls to be safe.

HIGH-FVOX-VOLUME SUIT CRASH
Changing the "HEV suit volume" slider in Settings, Audio to over half produces a "suitvolume" (CVar) over 1.0, as the slider range is 0 to 2.  Values over 1 crash the game when FVOX sounds are made.  For now, any references to "suitvolume" are divided by 2 to still make use of the full slider.

missing "640hud7mod.spr" crash on developer 2 fixed, bad reference to that in sprites/weapon_chumtoad.txt reverted.  Ammo icons are not even used.

Slight improvements made to crowbar tracing used to find a target.  Most notably, better at detecting head-hits (mostly on a direct-hit) for extra damage and the approximate-hit detection is a little better in general up close.  Particles also no longer drawn close to the camera on certain circumstances.

monster_scientist_dead and monster_barney_dead (although difficult to prove it was ever the case for the latter) now have mouth-graphics open as seen in some pre-release screenshots.  Does not apply to ingame killed NPC talkers, only these special pre-dead spawned ones.

ALSO, talkers slightly more responsive.  On being warned by nearby friends, scientists jump to a flee schedule immediately and barnies unholster their guns, although these things likely happened soon after the player came into sight anyway.
More importantly, NPC's should not wait to finish talking to a player while following and TASK_WAIT is forcing a delay.  No sense standing still during that time.

Houndeyes close eyes near the end of killed animations.  Squadleader houndeyes will also be more responsive to sounds immediately after playing leaderlook in some cases (used to be an enforced 5 second delay of ignoring sounds to turn and face)

SKILL.CFG:
Player ammo reserves and timed damage info (duration / damage per tick) can now be specified in skill.cfg.   Player ammo reserves are not specified per skill, only once.

Also skills to control whether NPCs drop weapons per difficulty, and whether scientists can heal per difficulty (not amount healed, this is already in the file)

Corpses move a bit in the direction of the last attack endured when enemies die.

hud_version changed.
0: green; very early sprites, battery in right sidebar (while weapon select is open)
1: newer sprite graphics for health/ammo, still battery in right sidebar.
2: battery moved to near health, shown at all times.
3: E3; closer to retail and yellow

RPG lasersight can be toggled on/off while it is forced invisible (like while reloading the RPG).  Also checks for tapping the mouse button to register this, not holding it down.

Hand grenades support grenade tossing.  Right-click to throw it a shorter, generally lower distance.  Holding both mouse buttons does not release the grenade.

hud_weaponSelectHidesLower - NEW CVAR CHOICE.
Use 2 to bump the right sidebar up (visible while weapon select is open typically)
to let hud_versions other than 2 show the bottom-right ammo numbers too.

Added generic hit/miss sounds to the bullsquid's tail-whip attack.  Seemed odd to make no noise if it misses, unlike most other melee.

CVar "useAlphaCrosshair" removed.  Use the built-in "crosshair" to handle this instead.
0: none
1: alpha crosshair (console "t" letter)
2: retail crosshair (varries per weapon)


MAJOR BUGFIX:  revive called commonreset, but did not get updates from some clientside CVars to restore to their old values.
That is, dying -> revive with cl_fvox on would act as though cl_fvox were off after (default).  May have explained other oddness following revives.

MAJOR BUGFIX:  likely cause of "game thinks you're dead when you're really not or vice versa" glitch addressed.

Various new HEV sounds able to be called for from sentences.txt, such as HEV_E1 on running out of battery, HEV_E2 on being gibbed, HEV_E3 40% of the time on non-gib deaths.

"torniquette_applied" from sentence "HEV_HEAL1" now one of the 3 choices for ending bleeding damage early with healing

Thrown grenades no longer jitter like the dickens.
Yes, those were supposed to be animations.

The 'view bob as though moving while killed and not moving' glitch fixed... maybe.

NEW COMMAND:  getmap, currentmap, thismap,   to get the name of the current map.  Imagine that!

The default skybox "desert" is enforced if a map lacks a "skyname" keyword to specify it.
That is, a map that does not give a skyname (like crossfire.bsp) no longer borrows the skybox from the previously run map ('night' if the player was previously on a2a2.bsp, for example)

Revive logic reworked.  Revives in bad conditions (interrupting moving map geometry like func_rotating, falling too far while dead, high trigger-inflicted damage, etc.) should no longer be possible.
Battery also hidden while dead, including waiting on revive (CVar hud_batteryhiddendead).

Barney 'running into crouched zombie' issue resolved.  Bad logic in determining a point to attack, and the fallback was pathfinding to them endlessly.  Which looks stupid when the foe is in plain sight.

Python lasersight fixed a bit, RPG one was a while back.  Leaving the python lasersight on while paused no longer crashes.  Yep.  That happened.

TODO:  scientists that fear the player in a very limited place lag the whole game like hell.
      See in a scientist on top of another NPC (zombie?), and shoot at the scientist without killing.  Lag ahoy.
