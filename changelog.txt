Previously mentioned zombie pushback change was incomplete.  Headshot damage no longer deals extra pushback.  Pushback damage also has diminishing returns with increasingly high damage in one frame: weak sources of damage (glock, mp5) deal full pushback while close-range shotgun blasts are cut by 25%, fully-charged gauss shots by half.
-ALSO, crossbow bolts no longer deal pushback, but still take bullet reduction percentages.
-Future support for explosions to deal pushback, or for more monsters to support pushback possible.

HUD battery no longer drawn on top of the pain flash effect.  Pain flash is now drawn after all typical UI draw calls to be safe.

HIGH-FVOX-VOLUME SUIT CRASH
Changing the "HEV suit volume" slider in Settings, Audio to over half produces a "suitvolume" (CVar) over 1.0, as the slider range is 0 to 2.  Values over 1 crash the game when FVOX sounds are made.  For now, any references to "suitvolume" are divided by 2 to still make use of the full slider.

missing "640hud7mod.spr" crash on developer 2 fixed, bad reference to that in sprites/weapon_chumtoad.txt reverted.  Ammo icons are not even used.

Slight improvements made to crowbar tracing used to find a target.  Most notably, better at detecting head-hits (mostly on a direct-hit) for extra damage and the approximate-hit detection is a little better in general up close.  Particles also no longer drawn close to the camera on certain circumstances.

monster_scientist_dead and monster_barney_dead (although difficult to prove it was ever the case for the latter) now have mouth-graphics open as seen in some pre-release screenshots.  Does not apply to ingame killed NPC talkers, only these special pre-dead spawned ones.

ALSO, talkers slightly more responsive.  On being warned by nearby friends, scientists jump to a flee schedule immediately and barnies unholster their guns, although these things likely happened soon after the player came into sight anyway.
More importantly, NPC's should not wait to finish talking to a player while following and TASK_WAIT is forcing a delay.  No sense standing still during that time.

Houndeyes close eyes near the end of killed animations.  Squadleader houndeyes will also be more responsive to sounds immediately after playing leaderlook in some cases (used to be an enforced 5 second delay of ignoring sounds to turn and face)

SKILL.CFG:
Player ammo reserves and timed damage info (duration / damage per tick) can now be specified in skill.cfg.   Player ammo reserves are not specified per skill, only once.
Also skills to control whether NPCs drop weapons per difficulty, and whether scientists can heal per difficulty (not amount healed, this is already in the file)

Corpses move a bit in the direction of the last attack endured when enemies die.

hud_version changed.
0: green; very early sprites, battery in right sidebar (while weapon select is open)
1: newer sprite graphics for health/ammo, still battery in right sidebar.
2: battery moved to near health, shown at all times.
3: E3; closer to retail and yellow

RPG lasersight can be toggled on/off while it is forced invisible (like while reloading the RPG).  Also checks for tapping the mouse button to register this, not holding it down.

Hand grenades support grenade tossing.  Right-click to throw it a shorter, generally lower distance.  Holding both mouse buttons does not release the grenade.

hud_weaponSelectHidesLower - NEW CVAR CHOICE.
Use 2 to bump the right sidebar up (visible while weapon select is open typically)
to let hud_versions other than 2 show the bottom-right ammo numbers too.

Added generic hit/miss sounds to the bullsquid's tail-whip attack.  Seemed odd to make no noise if it misses, unlike most other melee.

CVar "useAlphaCrosshair" removed.  Use the built-in "crosshair" to handle this instead.
0: none
1: alpha crosshair (console "t" letter)
2: retail crosshair (varries per weapon)


MAJOR BUGFIX:  revive called commonreset, but did not get updates from some clientside CVars to restore to their old values.
That is, dying -> revive with cl_fvox on would act as though cl_fvox were off after (default).  May have explained other oddness following revives.

MAJOR BUGFIX:  likely cause of "game thinks you're dead when you're really not or vice versa" glitch addressed.

Various new HEV sounds able to be called for from sentences.txt, such as HEV_E1 on running out of battery, HEV_E2 on being gibbed, HEV_E3 40% of the time on non-gib deaths.

"torniquette_applied" from sentence "HEV_HEAL1" now one of the 3 choices for ending bleeding damage early with healing

Thrown grenades no longer jitter like the dickens.
Yes, those were supposed to be animations.

The 'view bob as though moving while killed and not moving' glitch fixed... maybe.

NEW COMMAND:  getmap, currentmap, thismap,   to get the name of the current map.  Imagine that!

The default skybox "desert" is enforced if a map lacks a "skyname" keyword to specify it.
That is, a map that does not give a skyname (like crossfire.bsp) no longer borrows the skybox from the previously run map ('night' if the player was previously on a2a2.bsp, for example)

Revive logic reworked.  Revives in bad conditions (interrupting moving map geometry like func_rotating, falling too far while dead, high trigger-inflicted damage, etc.) should no longer be possible.
Battery also hidden while dead, including waiting on revive (CVar hud_batteryhiddendead).

Barney 'running into crouched zombie' issue resolved.  Bad logic in determining a point to attack, and the fallback was pathfinding to them endlessly.  Which looks stupid when the foe is in plain sight.

Python lasersight fixed a bit, RPG one was a while back.  Leaving the python lasersight on while paused no longer crashes.  Yep.  That happened.

TODO:  scientists that fear the player in a very limited place lag the whole game like hell.
      See in a scientist on top of another NPC (zombie?), and shoot at the scientist without killing.  Lag ahoy.
GOT IT.  And it was in a very bizarre circumstance like having a scripted sequence but being interrupted by a barnacle, then landing on top of a monster.
I'm surprised 300 people didn't run into this on their first playthrough, it honestly seems like that's how it always goes.

NEW CVAR:
monsterKilledToss - lets corpses move a short distance, depending on amount of overkill in the killing hit.

talker passives (scientists) no longer stare dumbly at sentries or turrets mowing them down.  Yeah.  what?

Shotgun viewmodel logic improved, most notably with holding down double-fire.  It should no longer be possible to play clip-entry sounds on exiting shell-loading.

Headshots to zombies no longer cause any pushback.

Various scripted-sequence breaking problems done, tested with a1a2's garg vs. hgrunt sequences.  Check for side-effects anywhere else but the slight change should be safe.

More unused scientist sounds added and tiny chance of a few pre-disaster ones to show up after disaster ('wear ties' and hungry ones.  They are whiny nerds after all)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.0_M 

Ladder logic changed, faster overall for alpha (cl_ladder 0), slower for retail-style (cl_ladder 1).
Overall, gap between the two in speed greatly reduced.

Battery sprites better scaled to not include dead space in the partial shading.
That is, 0 to 10% should make a difference in the appearance of the battery, not fill in empty
space below the battery (no change in appearance).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.0_N

NPC walker interp glitch (jitter while moving) fixed.

"deploy glock since saving game anim delaying to show silencer" issue fixed.

In skill.cfg, using "-1" will stop a timed damage type from having any effect, even the icon that "0" still gives.
Only bleeding listens for a value of -1 so far to guarantee never showing the icon, ordinary timed-damage logic runs infrequently and can miss it.

Timed damages also no longer deal damage during the immediate frame they are given.  That is, a zombie slash of 25 damage used to deal 26 (bleeding's '1' immediately),
on top of the duration times damage (15*1 on medium).  This also means damage durations of 0 or -1 won't deal any damage.

***able to get stuck in scientists at a vending machine & inspecting machines, TODO...***

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.0_O

Hits to Barney's helmet no longer cause blood or hit sounds, just like hgrunt and agrunt helmet/armor hits

Other old scientist pain sounds added back in.

PainSound reworked a bit, scientists and barnies will make pain noises less often on taking timed damage.

ALSO, timed damage does 15% damage to talkers, 60% for all other monsters/NPCs.
This makes timed damages much less of a certain 'death sentence' for NPC talkers.

Few sentences from unused files for Barnies added.

NPC's forced to unfollow from reaching the follower limit (1 by default) will not say the unfollow line.
Unfollow sentences also won't be attempted for unfollowing due to taking damage from other monsters.

Gauss beam improvements.  Beam colors follow the likely intended logic with some other enhancements.  Volume/attenuation for various damages redone.

Similar fix applied to egon in color only, no extra touchups.  No change between software or hardware graphics modes either.

Scientists should always (or at least very soon) put the syringe away if healing is no longer necessary or the scientist unfollows before healing.  They will also not withdraw the syringe simply because the target moves.

Movement over downward inclines and stairs is now as smooth as upward inclines/stairs in retail.

Idle animations for scientists and barnies slowed, especially in pre-disaster.  Common standing idles are slowed the most.  Slightly faster while talking.

Ladder jump-off force reduced a bit.  Jumping off a ladder now only works on the key (typically space) being pressed for the first frame, not continuously, so that holding space too long in a tight jump to a ladder doesn't immediately fall off.

Blood logic reworked, again.  Damage done per attack factors into the amount of blood.

Blood-spray decals will no longer be drawn if the blood-drip effect was disabled (usually from armor absorbing the shot, shows a ricochet effect).

Retail blood effect is available by CVar: "sv_bloodparticlemode", defaults to 1.

Mortar (prominent in a1a3b.bsp) nerfed, degree depends on skill.  On Hard difficulty, it is only slighlty less damaging, range is more significantly impacted.

Very minor agrunt improvements.  Won't aim extremely high/low on getting close while it range-attacks.
Also no longer adding retail blood sprite drops on melee hits.  Whoops.

Gibbed monster sound effects should no longer be overshadowed by other sounds, most notably like a barnacle making chew sounds shortly after gibbing what it held.

Gargantua can be hurt by gauss shots charged enough, but takes 30% less damage from them.

Gauss does 16% less damage on aircraft in non-critical areas (not the cockpit or engines).

Gauss makes hit-sounds on monsters.

Blood type 'green' restored to be distinct from 'yellow' all aliens had in retail, some monsters use this now.

Machines (mainly sentries) play metal-sounds when hit with bullets.

Snarks can now gib with alpha blood, not forced to retail.

Speed while crouched increased.

Viewpunch (recoil / getting knocked by melee hits, alpha ladder effect) decays more smoothly and slightly faster.
Viewpunch of alpha ladders reduced slightly on top of this.

Alpha ladder view effects moved from serverside-only (player.cpp) to pm_shared.c.  Might not appear different for singleplayer or low-latency multiplayer.

Hits on armored enemies (hgrunt/barney helmets, agrunt helemt or body plating).

All get the same 50% chance of a bullet ricochet effect the agrunt has for bullet hits, and damage logic changed.
~Bullet damage: Instead of near-0 damage for 20-or-under hits, damage reduced to 12%.  Even piercing hits to armor (over 20) do 15% less damage.
~Melee damage: Hits to armor reduced by 40% instead.
~Blast damage: no longer pays attention to armor hits, flat damage reduction that assumes it was hit.  Explosions are more of an 'area of effect' than a precise strike like other weapons, it doesn't make as much sense to care what hitgroup a line from an explosion to the center of an entity hits.
~ In general, HGrunts take 20% less damage from explosions, Agrunts take 30% less damage from explosions, Barnies take 50% less damage from explosions (their low health doesn't stop insta-kills from near direct hits)
~Barny kevlar more effective against weak bullet damages (60% reduction).
~HGrunt kevlar (body shots) reduces weak bullet damage (5 or less; includes mp5 and shotgun shells) lose 30% damage.  Higher bullet damage loses 15% damage instead.
~ Bullet damage anywhere else (arms, legs) loses 10%, Barnies too.  Non-armor agrunt bullet damage does 8% less damage.

AGrunts should no longer skip the sound-sentence-save system when playing some sounds (lead to 'sound not precached' warnings in console).  No file in the mentioned 'agrunt/bflinch.wav' of sequence 'bigflinch' exists, however.

Uncrouching rapidly no longer puts the player in the air momentarily.  Uncrouching while in the middle of a crouch is smooth now.

New CVAR: cl_interp_view_extra.  Default is 1 so that crouching/uncrouching rapidly looks smooth.  2 lets midair crouching/uncrouching look more smooth. 0 goes to no additional smoothness beyond retail (besides the downward stairs/incline improvement).

Scientists not in a combat state will run away when attacked with their backs turned.  Go figure.

Issue from falling monsters losing interp (animation smoothness) shortly after touching the ground from a fall (usually monsterKilledToss other than 0 to cause this) should be resolved, mostly.  Hacky solution.

CVar 'cl_server_interpolation' renamed to 'cl_interp_entity'.
New CVar:  'cl_interp_viewmodel'.  Simulates lack of interpolation to add choppiness to viewmodels when off.

Ricochet effect on agrunt armor & hgrunt/barney helmets uses the 'normal' of whatever surface it hit instead of going roughly in the direction of where it came from unconditionally.

recent-weapon-switching ('q' key by default) no longer ignores cl_holster.  Possible slight client/server synch issue with cl_holster in general fixed too.
